- **Direct Funding**: Remove intermediaries between investors and farmers
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates on project milestones and returns
- **Community Governance**: Decentralized decision-making for platform improvements

## 🏗 Built With

- **Scaffold-ETH 2**: Ethereum development stack
- **Hardhat**: Smart contract development and testing
- **Next.js**: React-based frontend framework
- **RainbowKit**: Wallet connection interface
- **Wagmi**: React hooks for Ethereum
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
